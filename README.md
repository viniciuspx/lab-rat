# lab-rat

*lab-rat* is a term I use to learn new languages, in this repo we will focus on *Rust*. So there will be a lot of comments in the codes to elucidate for me and maybe for anyone reading.

Why lab-rat? Because its sounds cool 🐀 🦀

Learning a language is like running a maze and try to understand how it works and how it was constructed.

-> Folowing the official [Manual](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Disclaimer

This code is mainly to learn Rust and have fun So the code will have a lot of comments for understand and explain inner bits of the rust lang

I believe that writing comment for study purposes combined with code makes you learn faster and absorb more information
