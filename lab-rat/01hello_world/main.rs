// compiling and runnig rust is a compiled lang so we run rustc and run the exec
// Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
// Use 4 spaces for identation

// Great way to start

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}

// println! is a macro the original function is println
// ! = calling a macro
// macros donâ€™t always follow the same rules as functions
